Demonstrates using a ‘Processing’ app (v4.x) with Swing components to display an electrocardiogram generated by an Arduino UNO with an Olimex EKG/EMG Shield.

Processing 4.x editor may be downloaded at https://processing.org/download

Settings for Olimex EKG/EMG Shield:

Ref E      Closed
3V/5V      5V
AIN SEL    A5(11,12 Closed)
D4/D9      D4

1. Download Processing 4.x application.
2. Upload the enclosed source code to an Arduino UNO with Olimex EKG Shield.
3. Run the enclosed Processing source code to create a desktop ecg monitor.
4. Compile/Run (or File/Export Application for your platform: Mac, Windows, or Linux).

There is a separate source code file for each platform.  The application was initially written for macOS, but has also been successfully run on Windows11 and Linux (popOS).  ecg4_linux is scaled up for high resolution monitors (may be run on linux or windows os).

For best results, suggest keeping Uno/Olimex board at least 12" from CPU to reduce electronic interference.

Screen shots are saved to pre-existing folders, as designated.  If destination folder is not designated, screen shot will be saved to sketch folder (or Application folder for compiled macOS app).
